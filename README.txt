Description: This project contains a LexicalAnalyzer and SyntacticalAnalyzer
class. Our work can be found in SyntacticalAnalyzer.cpp and 
SyntacticalAnalyer.h. I created a makefile routine called "make run" which will
test our program on all of the sample files provided in the P2Tests directory.
If any of the files does not exit, errors will be thrown if using "make run".
